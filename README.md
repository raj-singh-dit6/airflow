# Airflow Dynamic Dag Generator

### Familiarize yourself with Apache Airflow
In case you have not worked with Airflow in the past it does make sense if you briefly read the introduction of Apache
Airflow. Don't worry though, you do not need to be an Airflow pro to finish the session. A basic understanding the Airflow
principles helps though.
This tutorial is a good initial read to understand airflow: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/tutorial.html

### Setup your local environment
Please setup a working local environemnt and make sure you can execute one of the example DAGs provided with the Airflow installation.
